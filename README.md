# Assessing the Strength of Metamorphic Testing

This repository contains the complete data from our experiments for the paper "Assessing the Strength of Metamorphic Testing Applied to Optimization Software - Experience from Industry."

Due to confidentiality agreements, we cannot share the SUT's source code or mutated versions. Instead, we offer template scripts to replicate our method with any MATLAB program.
